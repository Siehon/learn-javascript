    <p><strong>In Javascript</strong> code must be change two places to gets what you want as a result, which means every time you change one you must make sure to change the other because this is the perfect use cases for a function. Because the function in Javascript all it doe's is that, it takes some kind of logic and then put that in a particular place that you can run, <em>ever you want to</em></p>
    <h3><em>How Javascript work</em></h3>
    <p>Javascript is so unique and large when it comes to <strong>function.</strong> What a does, a does not tells any errors if you dont passed any arigument. But it sets all the arigument that you never passed as <strong>Undefined.</strong></p>
  <p>In Javascript when ever variables are passed in a Function all need is to add a comman.</p>
  <p>For Example: 
    function sum(a,b){
        console.log(a + b) 
    }
    sum(1, 2)</p>
    <p>and that will be equal to <strong>3</strong></p>
